# Raw Data Exploration & Data Classification

Before starting **Lab 2**, it is important to understand why this lab exists and how it connects to the course. This lab is not about speed or memorizing SQL. It is about learning how professionals reason about **data governance**.

**Lab 2** is where the course transitions from **environment setup** to **governance thinking**.

- In **Lab 1**, you built infrastructure.  
- In **Lab 2**, you start acting like a **data steward**.

## What Lab 2 Is Actually Teaching

Lab 2 teaches you how to look at raw data and ask:

> **What responsibility comes with storing this information?**

You are not transforming data.  
You are evaluating **risk**, **ownership**, and **accountability**.

This lab develops four professional skills:

### 1) Data awareness
You learn how to inspect real tables and understand what they contain.

Not just columns — **meaning**.

### 2) Sensitivity reasoning
You decide whether data is:

- Public  
- Internal  
- Sensitive  
- Restricted  

There is no automatic rule.  
Your reasoning matters more than the label.

### 3) Governance documentation
You practice recording decisions in a structured register.

This mirrors how real organizations track compliance.

### 4) Stewardship thinking
You begin thinking like someone responsible for protecting data — not just querying it.

This is a mindset shift.

## How Lab 2 Connects to the Course Modules

### Connection to Module 1: Data Governance & Classification
Module 1 introduced the idea that not all data is equal.

Lab 2 makes that real.

You are:

- identifying personal data  
- evaluating financial information  
- assigning governance categories  
- justifying decisions  

This is governance in action, not theory.

The governance register you create is a simplified version of enterprise data catalogs used in regulated industries.

### Connection to Module 2: Data Modeling Foundations
Before modeling data, professionals must understand:

- what the data represents  
- who owns it  
- how risky it is  
- how it should be handled  

Classification informs architecture decisions.

Sensitive data influences:

- access controls  
- lifecycle retention  
- encryption policies  
- monitoring requirements  

Lab 2 builds the reasoning layer that supports future modeling and security work.

You cannot design safe systems without understanding the data first.

## How Lab 2 Builds on Lab 1

Lab 1 created your environment.

Lab 2 uses that environment for governance work.

Specifically:

- raw schema → represents ungoverned incoming data  
- student schema → represents governed workspace  
- governance register → formal decision record  

This separation mirrors real enterprise architecture:

> **raw data ≠ governed data**

Professionals never mix the two.

That boundary is one of the most important ideas in modern data administration.

## What You Should Focus On Mentally

This lab is about judgment, not syntax.

If you feel uncertain while classifying data, that is expected.

You are practicing professional reasoning:

- What could go wrong if this leaks?  
- Who should own this field?  
- How long should it be retained?  
- What harm could misuse cause?  

There is no single correct answer.

There are defensible answers.

Your goal is to explain your reasoning clearly.

That is what real governance work looks like.

---

## Reflection Guidance

The reflection is not a quiz.

It is a short professional reasoning exercise.

Good reflections:

- explain uncertainty  
- discuss tradeoffs  
- reference risk  
- mention accountability  
- connect classification to real-world impact  

Avoid:

- “Because it is PII”  
- one-word answers  
- repeating the prompt  

Think like a data steward explaining a decision to a compliance officer.

## Why This Lab Matters Professionally

Organizations fail audits not because data exists.

They fail because no one documented why decisions were made.

This lab simulates:

- governance registers  
- classification audits  
- accountability trails  
- stewardship ownership  

You are practicing how enterprises defend their data decisions.

That skill is transferable across:

- cybersecurity  
- analytics  
- compliance  
- cloud architecture  
- enterprise IT  
- data engineering  

This is real-world administrative thinking.

## Final Perspective

Lab 2 is where the course shifts from:

> **“How do I run tools?”**

to

> **“How do I protect information responsibly?”**

That shift is what separates technicians from data administrators.

Take your time. Think carefully.  
**Your reasoning matters more than speed.**
