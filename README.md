# IT4065C – Data Technologies Administration  
## Enterprise Data Governance & Architecture Framework

Welcome to the public repository for **IT4065C: Data Technologies Administration**.

This course is designed as a full-lifecycle enterprise data architecture simulation.

Students do not simply learn tools.

They learn how to design, govern, protect, validate, and defend modern data systems.

---

## Course Philosophy

Modern organizations do not fail because they lack data.

They fail because they cannot govern it.

This course integrates:

- Data modeling  
- Lifecycle architecture  
- Workload separation (OLTP vs OLAP)  
- Governance strategy  
- Role-based access control  
- Monitoring and audit reasoning  
- Executive communication  

The goal is to move students from:

> “I can write queries.”

to

> “I can design accountable data systems.”

## Labs – Enterprise Lifecycle Simulation

The lab sequence builds progressively through governance layers.

```

Lab 1 → Infrastructure Setup
Lab 2 → Data Classification
Lab 3 → Layered Modeling Architecture
Lab 4 → Lifecycle & Lineage Validation
Lab 5 → Access Control Enforcement
Lab 6 → Monitoring & Audit Evaluation

```

Together, they simulate the enterprise lifecycle:

```

Design → Classify → Model → Execute → Protect → Monitor → Evaluate

```

Each lab introduces one governance layer and validates it technically.

## Capstone – Governed Retail Data Architecture

The capstone integrates the entire lab sequence into a professional architecture simulation.

Students design, defend, and validate a secure retail data platform across seven phases:

1. Discovery  
2. Logical Data Modeling  
3. Workload Strategy  
4. Governance Overlay  
5. Evidence & Enforcement  
6. Executive Defense  
7. Individual Reflection  

This capstone emphasizes:

- Risk-based reasoning  
- Accountability mapping  
- Lifecycle protection  
- Evidence-based architectural validation  
- Executive-level communication  

📄 See: `capstone_project/README.md`

---

## Technology Stack

This course uses a practical, industry-aligned toolchain:

- PostgreSQL  
- dbt (data build tool)  
- Linux/Ubuntu environment  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Audit log monitoring  

The framework is tool-agnostic but governance-centered.

Tools may evolve.

Architectural discipline remains constant.

---

## Skills Developed

By completing this course, students gain experience in:

- Enterprise data modeling  
- Lifecycle-aware architecture  
- Governance strategy integration  
- Security enforcement reasoning  
- Risk and compliance analysis  
- Monitoring & audit interpretation  
- Executive communication  
- Evidence-based design validation  

This is applied data administration — not theoretical database instruction.

---

## For Educators

This repository demonstrates a governance-centered approach to teaching data technologies.

Key pedagogical principles:

- Architecture before tools  
- Governance embedded in structure  
- Lifecycle separation enforced technically  
- Evidence required for claims  
- Executive communication simulated  

The framework can be adapted to:

- Different industries  
- Alternative tooling stacks  
- Shorter or longer academic terms  

The emphasis is on accountability, not syntax.

---

## Professional Orientation

This course is designed to prepare students for roles such as:

- Data Engineer  
- Analytics Engineer  
- Data Governance Analyst  
- Data Platform Administrator  
- Enterprise Data Architect (entry-level pathway)  

Students leave understanding not just how systems work —  
but how systems must be defended.

---

## Final Perspective

Enterprise data architecture requires more than technical fluency.

It requires:

- Structured reasoning  
- Risk awareness  
- Governance discipline  
- Proof of enforceability  
- Clear executive communication  

This repository represents a complete lifecycle framework for developing those competencies.
