# Phase 7 – Individual Reflection  
## Architectural Self-Assessment

---

## Overview

In this final phase, you step out of the group role and reflect individually as a professional data architect.

This reflection is not a summary of the project.

It is a structured evaluation of:

- How your thinking about data systems evolved  
- How your decisions matured over time  
- What governance means in practice  
- How your architectural reasoning developed  

Strong architects constantly review their own decision-making processes.

Professional growth requires deliberate reflection.

---

## Reflection Prompt

Write a professional reflection (maximum one page) addressing the sections below.

Your writing should read like an architectural self-assessment — not a diary entry.

Use complete sentences and structured paragraphs.

Avoid bullet-only responses.

---

## 1. Your Architectural Role

What responsibilities did you assume within your team?

Examples may include:

- Structural modeling decisions  
- Governance classification  
- Lifecycle strategy design  
- Risk analysis  
- Lab-to-project evidence translation  
- Workload separation logic  

Explain how your contributions influenced the final architecture.

Focus on decisions and impact.

---

## 2. Challenges & Decision-Making

Identify the most difficult architectural decision your team faced.

Explain:

- Why it was complex  
- What trade-offs were considered  
- How your team resolved it  
- What risks were involved  

Focus on reasoning, not emotion.

Architectural maturity is revealed in difficult trade-offs.

---

## 3. Lessons About Governance

Reflect on what this project taught you about:

- Data governance  
- Lifecycle design  
- Security enforcement  
- Auditability  
- Risk analysis  

Be specific.

Avoid generic statements such as:

“Governance is important.”

Instead, explain what governance looks like in structural practice.

---

## 4. Alignment with Course Learning

Select at least two course-level learning outcomes.

Explain:

- How your work demonstrated those competencies  
- What evidence supports your claim  
- How your thinking changed compared to the beginning of the semester  

Use concrete examples from your capstone architecture.

---

## 5. Future Improvement

If given additional time:

- What would you redesign?  
- What unresolved risks remain?  
- What architectural weaknesses would you address?  

Professional architects acknowledge system limitations.

Recognizing residual risk demonstrates maturity.

---

## Requirements

- Maximum one page  
- Clear, professional writing  
- Direct references to your project decisions  
- Complete sentences  
- Structured paragraphs  

This is not graded on grammar perfection.

It is evaluated on clarity of thought and architectural reasoning.

---

## Deliverable

Submit a PDF titled:

```

Phase7_Reflection_YourName.pdf

```

This is an individual submission.

---

## Evaluation Focus

Your reflection will be assessed based on:

- Depth of analysis  
- Architectural reasoning  
- Connection to course learning  
- Clarity of expression  
- Professional tone  

Strong reflections demonstrate intellectual growth.

Weak reflections summarize activities without analyzing decisions.

---

## Final Perspective

The capstone required you to:

- Discover ambiguity  
- Enforce structure  
- Separate workloads  
- Overlay governance  
- Validate enforceability  
- Defend decisions  

This reflection asks:

How did that process change the way you think?

Architecture is not only about systems.

It is about disciplined reasoning.

The strongest architects are those who evaluate their own thinking.

This is your final professional exercise.
