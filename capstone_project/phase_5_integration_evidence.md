# Phase 5 – Integration & Evidence  
## Proving Governance Through Technical Validation

---

## Overview

Throughout this course, you operated in two environments:

- Labs (controlled test environment)
- Capstone Project (production-level architecture)

Professional data architects must prove that their design is technically enforceable before deploying it to production.

Phase 5 is where you use lab artifacts as architectural proof.

You are translating:

Lab Result → Architectural Validation

This phase demonstrates that your Retail data governance architecture is not theoretical.

It is enforceable.

---

## The Architectural Mindset: Proof, Not Description

Operators describe what happened in a lab.

Architects explain what the lab proves about system design.

Your evaluation depends on how well you connect:

- Technical evidence
- Governance principles
- Architectural decisions
- Risk mitigation strategies

Screenshots alone do not earn credit.

Translation earns credit.

---

## Your Task

Complete two sections of your portfolio workbook:

- **Phase_5_Evaluation** (Architectural reasoning)
- **Phase_6_Evidence** (Visual proof documentation)

You must provide three categories of architectural proof:

1. Lifecycle governance proof  
2. Security enforcement proof  
3. Monitoring & audit proof  

Each proof must include:

- Screenshot evidence  
- Governance connection  
- Written explanation of what the evidence proves  

---

# Part 1 – Architectural Evaluation (Phase_5_Evaluation)

This section is your explanation layer.

For each governance pillar, you must document:

- What you are proving  
- Whether your architecture satisfies it  
- What the lab evidence demonstrates  

### Required Proof Categories

You must include at minimum:

- Lifecycle governance proof  
- Security enforcement proof  
- Monitoring & audit proof  

---

### Explanation Requirement

Your explanation must answer:

> What does this lab evidence prove about my governance architecture?

Do not describe the screenshot.

Translate its architectural implication.

Example:

❌ “This shows a DAG.”

✅ “This proves my lifecycle governance strategy. All data must pass through staging before reaching analytics, preventing unvalidated data from entering executive reporting.”

Strong answers connect evidence to business protection.

---

# Part 2 – Visual Evidence (Phase_6_Evidence)

This section contains screenshot documentation.

Each entry must include:

1. Clear label of the screenshot  
2. Explanation of what capability is proven  
3. Governance principle it supports  

Your explanation should focus on:

- Enforceability
- Risk reduction
- Structural protection
- Accountability

Not tool mechanics.

---

## Required Proof Types

You must include the following three categories:

---

### 1. Lifecycle Governance Proof

Source: dbt DAG or lifecycle execution (Lab 3 / Module 3)

This evidence must demonstrate:

- Controlled data flow
- Structured transformation boundaries
- Prevention of raw-to-report shortcuts

Connection to Capstone:

Supports Phase 2 structural integrity and Phase 3 workload strategy.

It proves lifecycle governance is enforceable.

---

### 2. Security Enforcement Proof

Source: Role-Based Access Control & masking validation (Lab 5)

This evidence must demonstrate:

- Privilege isolation
- Role-based access boundaries
- Masking enforcement
- Least privilege behavior

Connection to Capstone:

Supports Phase 4 sensitivity and protection model.

It proves governance policies can be technically enforced.

---

### 3. Monitoring & Audit Proof

Source: Audit logs and monitoring outputs (Lab 6)

This evidence must demonstrate:

- Visibility into user behavior
- Detection of denied access attempts
- Traceability of system actions
- Accountability via metadata

Connection to Capstone:

Supports Phase 4 risk and accountability strategy.

It proves governance does not end at prevention — it includes monitoring.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Your work will be evaluated based on:

### Lab-to-Architecture Translation
Do you explain what the lab proves about your design?

### Governance Reasoning
Are connections aligned with Phase 4 governance decisions?

### Evidence Clarity
Are screenshots readable and clearly labeled?

### Architectural Consistency
Does your proof align with your structural and governance claims?

### Professional Explanation
Does your reasoning reflect architectural maturity?

Weak submissions describe tools.

Strong submissions explain enforceability.

---

## Why This Phase Matters

Many architectural proposals fail because they lack proof of feasibility.

Executives and compliance officers ask:

- Can this actually be enforced?
- Is lifecycle control real?
- Are access controls technically validated?
- Is monitoring operational?

Phase 5 answers those questions with evidence.

You are demonstrating that your governance architecture:

- Is enforceable  
- Is measurable  
- Is auditable  
- Is technically grounded  

Evidence builds institutional trust.

---

## Final Perspective

Phases 1–4 built your architecture.

Phase 5 proves it works.

Architects do not just design systems.

They validate them.

Evidence transforms design into credibility.
