# Phase 1 – Discovery  
## Requirements Extraction from Business Context

---

## Overview

In this phase, you are acting as a Junior Data Architecture team.

You are not drawing ER diagrams yet.

You are not designing tables.

You are performing **Discovery**.

Your objective is to extract structured technical requirements from an intentionally messy business conversation.

This phase trains you to:

- Interpret ambiguity  
- Identify architectural signals  
- Separate business language from technical structure  
- Document uncertainty professionally  

Before architecture comes clarity.

Discovery is clarity.

---

## The Living Workbook Principle

Professional architecture work is iterative.

Discovery artifacts are not disposable.

They are promoted into formal models.

All Phase 1 work must be documented in the **Governed Data Architecture Portfolio Workbook (V2)**.

This workbook serves as:

- Your architectural record  
- Your governance reasoning log  
- Your promotion foundation for Phase 2 (Logical Data Model)  

Work completed here will directly inform structural design decisions later.

Discovery is not brainstorming.

It is traceable architectural preparation.

## Case Study Context

**Organization Type:** Retail provider (online and in-store operations)  
**Architectural Objective:** Design a system that balances:

- Operational speed  
- Analytical accuracy  
- Governance enforcement  
- Regulatory compliance  
- Executive visibility  

You will analyze a stakeholder interview transcript containing:

- Business terminology  
- Operational constraints  
- Compliance references  
- Implicit system requirements  

Your responsibility is to convert narrative language into structured architectural components.

## Your Task

Working in small architecture teams:

Complete the **Phase_1_Requirements** sheet in the portfolio workbook.

You must:

---

### 1. Identify Entities (Nouns)

What “things” must the organization track?

Examples:

- Customer  
- Product  
- Order  
- Store  
- Inventory  

Entities represent persistent system components.

If it must be stored, queried, or governed — it is likely an entity.

---

### 2. Identify Relationships (Verbs)

How do entities interact?

Examples:

- Customer places Order  
- Store fulfills Order  
- Product belongs to Category  

Relationships define structural dependencies.

Without relationships, architecture is fragmented.

---

### 3. Identify Attributes

What details describe each entity?

Examples:

- Customer → Email, Date of Birth, Loyalty Tier  
- Product → MSRP, SKU, Category  
- Order → Timestamp, Payment Method  

Attributes must be mapped to the correct entity.

Misplaced attributes signal modeling immaturity.

---

### 4. Assign Confidence Levels

Each identified component must be marked:

- High Confidence  
- Medium Confidence  
- Low Confidence  

This reflects professional humility.

If marked as **Low**, you must document:

- What is unclear  
- What additional question you would ask  
- What risk ambiguity introduces  

Strong architects document uncertainty explicitly.

---

## Deliverable

Submit the completed **Phase_1_Requirements** workbook.

Requirements:

- All group members listed  
- Entities clearly defined  
- Relationships structured  
- Attributes mapped precisely  
- Confidence levels assigned  
- Notes provided where required  

Discovery quality directly impacts Phase 2.

Weak discovery produces weak architecture.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Your work will be assessed based on:

### Completion  
Are all major entities and relationships represented?

### Precision  
Are attributes mapped correctly to their entities?

### Professional Reasoning  
Do Low Confidence items include thoughtful stakeholder follow-up questions?

### Structural Readiness  
Is the discovery work usable as input for a Logical Data Model?

Discovery is not about guessing correctly.

It is about documenting thinking clearly.

---

## Why This Phase Matters

Organizations fail at architecture not because engineers cannot model.

They fail because requirements were misunderstood.

Discovery prevents:

- Structural rework  
- Compliance gaps  
- Data ownership confusion  
- Governance blind spots  

This phase builds your ability to:

- Translate business language into structured systems  
- Detect hidden requirements  
- Recognize regulatory implications early  
- Document ambiguity professionally  

You are learning to think like a systems architect.

---

## Final Perspective

Architecture does not begin with diagrams.

It begins with disciplined listening.

Strong discovery leads to strong structure.

This phase is the intellectual foundation of the entire capstone.
