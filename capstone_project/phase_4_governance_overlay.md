# Phase 4 – Governance Overlay  
## Translating Architecture into Accountability

---

## Overview

In Phases 1–3, you built a technical architecture.

In Phase 4, you overlay governance.

You are no longer designing how data flows.

You are designing how the organization survives risk.

Every table in your system carries:

- Legal exposure  
- Financial liability  
- Ethical responsibility  
- Reputational impact  

Architecture without governance is incomplete.

This phase converts structure into accountability.

---

## The Mindset: From Engineer to Risk Officer

Systems do not fail only when they crash.

They fail when:

- Customer data leaks  
- Compliance rules are ignored  
- Retention policies are unclear  
- Ownership is undefined  

This phase simulates a governance review board.

You are not inventing policies.

You are extracting them from business reality.

Professional architects do not create arbitrary rules.

They interpret stakeholder language into enforceable structure.

---

## Evidence Requirement: Transcript Grounding

Every governance decision must be traceable to the business interview transcript.

If asked:

> “Where did this policy come from?”

You must be able to reference:

- A specific statement  
- An implied operational requirement  
- A compliance constraint  
- A business objective  

Governance choices that contradict stakeholder evidence lack defensibility.

This phase measures your ability to translate messy business language into structured governance architecture.

## Your Task

Complete the **Phase_4_Governance** section of your portfolio workbook.

Governance must be applied to the entities already defined in Phases 1–3.

You may not:

- Rename tables  
- Invent new entities  
- Apply governance to non-existent structures  

Governance overlays architecture.

It does not replace it.

---

## The Four Pillars of Governance

You must evaluate each entity using four pillars:

1. Ownership (Accountability)  
2. Sensitivity  
3. Retention  
4. Protection (Risk Consequence)  

---

## 1. Ownership (Accountability)

Every entity must have an accountable business owner.

Ownership answers:

- Who is responsible if this data is misused?
- Who approves retention decisions?
- Who responds to regulatory inquiries?

Undefined ownership equals unmanaged risk.

Ownership must be defensible using transcript evidence.

---

## 2. Sensitivity Classification

Sensitivity reflects impact — not convenience.

You must reason using professional classification language:

- Public
- Internal
- Confidential
- Restricted

The workbook records sensitivity as:

- Low
- Medium
- High

Use the following mapping logic:

| Governance Classification | Retail Meaning | Workbook Value |
|----------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Public                     | Safe to disclose publicly | Low |
| Internal                   | Operationally sensitive | Medium |
| Confidential               | Customer or competitive harm | High |
| Restricted                 | Regulated / legally protected data | High |

Sensitivity should be evaluated based on:

- Customer harm  
- Competitive exposure  
- Legal consequences  
- Regulatory requirements  

Sensitivity reflects impact severity.

---

## 3. Retention Strategy

For each entity, determine:

- Short-term (Operational / Hot)
- Long-term (Analytical / Cold)
- Both

Retention must align with:

- Business needs  
- Compliance constraints  
- Analytical value  
- Legal mandates  

You are interpreting retention logic from the stakeholder context — not inventing generic policy.

---

## 4. Governance Risk Statement (Protection)

For each entity, write a precise 1–2 sentence risk consequence statement:

> If this table leaked publicly, what specific legal, financial, or ethical consequence would occur?

Weak example:

“This would be bad.”

Strong example:

“Exposure of customer emails enables phishing campaigns and violates consumer privacy regulations, exposing the company to regulatory fines and class-action lawsuits.”

Executives act on consequences, not abstractions.

Your risk statement must:

- Be retail-specific  
- Reflect realistic consequences  
- Align with your sensitivity level  
- Match the business context  

If your risk statement could apply to any company in any industry, it is insufficient.

Governance is contextual.

---

## Internal Consistency Requirement

Your governance decisions must align across pillars.

For example:

- A High sensitivity table should not have Low risk consequences.
- Long-term retention of regulated data must be justified.
- Ownership assignments must reflect operational responsibility.

Inconsistent governance signals architectural immaturity.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Phase 4 will be evaluated on:

### Transcript-Grounded Reasoning
Are decisions traceable to business context?

### Realistic Ownership Mapping
Do owners reflect operational accountability?

### Sensitivity Accuracy
Do classifications reflect impact severity?

### Risk Precision
Are consequence statements specific and defensible?

### Cross-Phase Consistency
Do governance decisions align with your model and workload strategy?

Strong governance architecture reads like a defensible policy framework.

Weak governance reads like generic compliance filler.

---

## Why This Phase Matters

Many data breaches occur not because systems were poorly coded —  
but because governance was poorly defined.

Common governance failures:

- No retention enforcement  
- No assigned owner  
- Underestimated sensitivity  
- Vague risk acknowledgment  

Governance protects:

- Customers  
- Brand reputation  
- Legal compliance  
- Executive credibility  

This phase trains you to design systems that survive regulatory scrutiny.

---

## Final Perspective

Phases 1–3 asked:

> Can the system function?

Phase 4 asks:

> Can the organization defend it?

Architecture without governance is fragile.

Governance transforms structure into accountability.

This is where technical design becomes institutional responsibility.
