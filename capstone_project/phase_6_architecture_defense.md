# Phase 6 – Architecture Defense  
## Executive Review Board Simulation

---

## Overview

You have completed your architecture.

Now you must defend it.

In professional practice, data architects present their systems to an Architecture Review Board (ARB) — a panel that evaluates whether a system is:

- Secure  
- Scalable  
- Compliant  
- Operationally sound  
- Worth deploying  

Phase 6 simulates that executive review.

You are not presenting screenshots.

You are defending decisions.

---

## The Executive Mindset

Executives do not evaluate syntax.

They evaluate risk.

They care about:

- Regulatory exposure  
- Data protection  
- Financial liability  
- Scalability under growth  
- Institutional trust  

Your job is to translate technical structure into business confidence.

If you explain tools instead of decisions, you are speaking to engineers — not executives.

---

## Your Task

Create a **10-slide architecture defense presentation** explaining why your Retail system is:

- Governed  
- Secure  
- Scalable  
- Auditable  

You will present this to a simulated executive board (the class).

Your workbook is your evidence.

Your slides are your argument.

---

## Required Slide Structure

You must include all of the following sections.

---

### Slide 1 – System Overview

Explain:

- What system did you design?  
- Who are the key stakeholders?  
- Why governance is essential in this context  

Focus on business purpose, not technical configuration.

---

### Slide 2 – Core Architecture

Present:

- High-level entity model  
- Major structural relationships  
- Why structure protects integrity  

Explain how structural design prevents data inconsistency.

---

### Slide 3 – Workload Strategy

Demonstrate:

- Separation of OLTP and OLAP  
- Why analytics cannot run on production tables  
- How your architecture prevents performance collisions  

This is your scalability argument.

---

### Slide 4 – Lifecycle Governance

Show:

- Raw → Staging → Analytics flow  
- Validation boundaries  
- Medallion-style separation  

Explain how lifecycle design protects executive reporting from unvalidated data.

---

### Slide 5 – Governance Overlay

Present:

- Ownership assignments  
- Sensitivity classifications  
- Retention strategy  

Explain:

- Who is accountable  
- Why certain data carries higher risk  
- How governance aligns with business reality  

This is your accountability argument.

---

### Slide 6 – Security Enforcement

Explain:

- Role-Based Access Control  
- Sensitive table isolation  
- Principle of least privilege  

Focus on:

- How unauthorized access is prevented  
- Why sensitive data is compartmentalized  

This is your protection argument.

---

### Slide 7 – Monitoring & Audit

Demonstrate:

- Risk detection capability  
- Visibility into denied access attempts  
- Audit trail functionality  

Explain why prevention alone is insufficient.

Auditability builds institutional trust.

---

### Slide 8 – Risk Scenario

Choose one high-risk table.

Explain:

If this table were exposed:

- What legal consequences occur?  
- What financial impact occurs?  
- What ethical harm occurs?  

This tests governance maturity.

Executives fund risk mitigation, not diagrams.

---

### Slide 9 – Architectural Strengths

Explain what your system does well:

- Scalability  
- Protection  
- Governance clarity  
- Audit readiness  
- Structural integrity  

Be specific.

---

### Slide 10 – Future Improvements

If given additional time:

- What would you enhance?  
- What residual risks remain?  
- Where is the system weakest?  

Architectural maturity includes acknowledging limits.

---

## Presentation Guidelines

- 8–12 minutes total  
- Slides must be visual, not text-heavy  
- Diagrams encouraged  
- Minimal bullet text  
- Do not read slides verbatim  
- Speak to executives, not engineers  

This is a defense — not a script.

---

## Deliverables

Submit:

- Final presentation (PDF or PPT format)
- Completed Master Portfolio Workbook (all phases)

All architectural phases must be coherent and internally consistent.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Your defense will be evaluated on:

- Architectural reasoning  
- Governance integration  
- Clarity of explanation  
- Risk understanding  
- Executive communication quality  
- Structural coherence across phases  

Strong presentations demonstrate confidence without technical overload.

Weak presentations describe tools instead of explaining decisions.

---

## Why This Phase Matters

Many technically sound architectures fail executive review because:

- Risk is poorly explained  
- Governance is unclear  
- Scalability is unproven  
- Compliance alignment is weak  

Technical competence is necessary.

Executive trust is decisive.

This phase trains you to earn that trust.

---

## Final Perspective

Phases 1–5 built and validated your architecture.

Phase 6 proves you can defend it.

Architects are not only designers.

They are communicators.

They do not just build systems.

They justify them.

Welcome to executive-level architecture.
